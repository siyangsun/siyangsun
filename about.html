<p>what do you think it means to get to know somebody? is it to learn about their hobbies? their past? their dreams of the future? their beliefs? their sense of humor? the way they smile when they know something you don't? maybe all of these?<br><br>

well... i don't know LOL. but now that we're on that topic, here's some of that about me stuff. my favorite ways to spend my alone time is either drawing, listening to music (i love doing this WITH people too!), making music, coding, or surfing the web with intention. i grew up in some combination of toronto and boulder. i went to school in los angeles and currently reside there. i wish there was better transit here, but i manage. i believe in new ideas, in universal access to public goods, in incremental improvement, and in the good intentions of most people. a lot of things make me laugh. what i like about knowing something you don't is that i get to experience learning it all over again with you.<br><br>

if you made it this far and feel like some of that resonates with you (or maybe disgusts you...?) you can find me elsewhere on the internet at any of these locations. <br><br><a href="/aliases">here's a list!</a></p>
