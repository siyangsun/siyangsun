			<h1>About</h1>
		  	<p>
I grew up and spent most of my life in two places: Toronto, Ontario and Boulder, Colorado. I was ready for a change after 14 years in the cold, so I made my way to UCLA for college, where I majored in Math Economics. After graduating from UCLA in 2018, I was lucky enough to join UCLA Anderson's second cohort of the MSBA (Master of Science in Business Analytics) program. I'm currently work as a Data Scientist at Retina AI, building cutting-edge models that predict customer behavior. Though my education and profession are deeply entrenched in data science and tech, I don't feel like that tells my whole story! I love science fiction, art, music of all kinds, astronomy, paleontology, and many things sociological and spiritual.
<strong>This website is for me to organize and share what I have done, what I am doing, and what I want to do. </strong>
