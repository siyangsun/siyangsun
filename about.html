			<h1>About</h1>
		  	<p>
Hey, my name is Siyang. I'm a third year student at UCLA, studying Math Economics and working towards a specialization in computing. If you came here to read about my Bahamas vacation and how much I love my cats, you're probably in the wrong place (well, you might see some of that <a href="/blog"> here</a>). Sure, I love all the things your stereotypical college student loves: food, cats, Netflix, social media, sleep, memes, Fetty Wap's new single... But I also love computation and creativity. I love calculations, math, finance, data, computation, and analyzing things where analyzing things isn't warranted. I love art, graphic design, digital painting, photography, and music production, and I want to talk about those things. I, like many late-teens/early-twenty-somethings these days, want to figure out my place in the world, and do all the big things I dreamed of when I was a little kid. Not much has changed; young people will do what young people will do. The only difference is now we have a little more help sorting out all those stray thoughts and aspirations.
<strong>This website is for me to organize and share what I have done, what I am doing, and what I want to do. </strong>
