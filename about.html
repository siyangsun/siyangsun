        what do you think it means to get to know somebody? is it to learn about
        their hobbies? their past? their dreams of the future? their beliefs?
        their sense of humor? the way they smile when they know something you
        don't? maybe all of these?<br /><br />

        well... i don't know LOL. but now that we're on that topic, here's an
        attempt at having you get to know me, at least just a little bit. my
        favorite ways to spend my alone time is either drawing, listening to
        music (i love doing this WITH people too!), making music, coding, or
        surfing the web with intention to connect ideas and people with each
        other. i grew up in some combination of toronto and boulder. i went to
        school in los angeles and lived there for a while. now i live in
        brooklyn, and i'm loving it so far! i believe in trying new things, in
        universal access to public goods, in incremental improvement, in the
        potential of art to change lives, and in the good intentions of most
        people. a lot of things make me laugh; maybe too many things. what i
        like about knowing something you don't is that i get to experience
        learning it all over again with you.<br /><br />

        if you made it this far and feel like some of that resonates with you
        (or maybe disgusts you...?) you can find me elsewhere on the internet in
        various locations. <br /><br /><a href="/aliases">here's a list!</a>
