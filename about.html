			<h1>About</h1>
		  	<p>
Hey, my name is Siyang. I'm a second year student at UCLA, studying Business-Economics and working towards a minor in math. If you came here to read about my Bahamas vacation and how much I love my cats, you're probably in the wrong place (well, you might see some of that <a href="/blog"> here</a>. Sure, I love all the things your <i>stereotypical</i> college student loves: food, cats, Netflix, social media, sleep, memes, Fetty Wap's new single... But I also love computation and creativity. I love calculations, math, finance, data, computation, and analyzing things where analyzing things isn't warranted. I love art, graphic design, digital painting, photography, and music production. I, like many late-teens/early-twenty-somethings these days, want to figure out my place in the world, and do all the big things I dreamed of when I was a little kid. Not much has changed; young people will do what young people will do. The only difference is now we have a little more help sorting out all those stray thoughts and aspirations.
<strong>This website is for me to organize and share what I have done, what I am doing, and what I want to do. </strong> 
I am interested in startups, data science, finance, economics, tech, and the future. I know my way around a computer and the internet.. evidently. Every day I realize how much I have left to learn, and that excites me. I can type at around 80 wpm. I know Python, C++, and Java, and have some working knowledge of Javascript, SQL, and Linux. I know enough HTML and CSS to build this website. I know Adobe Photoshop like the back of my hand, and the rest of Adobe Creative Suite like the back of my head (I've gotten a good look a few times). I love to draw. I do graphic design work for <a href="https://www.facebook.com/lolucla/?fref=ts">LoL club @ UCLA</a>, and started my own art club. I've taken and passed the Society of Actuaries' <a href="https://www.soa.org/education/exam-req/edu-exam-p-detail.aspx">Exam P</a>. I used to do math competitions and I don't hate my parents. My amazing high school team and I tied for 9th at the 2014 National Science Bowl. I love working with a team. I love working on my own. I love to <b>learn</b>. I love to <b>build things</b>. I love <b>being alive</b>.
