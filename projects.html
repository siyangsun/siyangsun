		 <h1>Projects</h1>
		 <h2>These are some projects I've worked on or am working on right now.</h2>
		  <p><strong>This website</strong>: I'm working on a personal website, through github pages, that will showcase things that are important to me. <a href="http://siyangsun.github.io/">Link</a></p>
		  <p><strong>UC 4th Annual Case Competition</strong>: I competed in a case competition in the first week of January featuring several schools around California, sponsored by Kaiser Permanente. You can read more about it <a href="http://siyangsun.github.io/blog/general/2016/01/12/case-competition.html">here</a>.</p>		  
		  <p><strong>A stream overlay</strong>: League of Legends at UCLA has just partnered up with <a href="http://www.afreeca.tv/">Afreeca TV</a>, which means we will be streaming tournaments we run from now on. I am building a stream overlay to have a clean interface, as well as to support our sponsors.</p>
		  <p><strong>International League Tournament/strong>: We'll also be running a tournament in collaboration with UCLA's International Student Society, running this month. The tournament will be livestreamed on <a href="http://www.afreeca.tv/36855110">Afreeca TV</a>, and will have teams of players representing several NGOs.</p>
